### Week 3 
---
#### Part 1 
<details><summary><em>Code review</em></summary>
<p>

_What went well:_

- Good job implementing Markup!:
```
## Monetize Data Science/AI 
### Scrape a list of websites looking for obsolete technologies and possible improvements.
#### Filter for English language websites
#### Filter for customer facing websites generating revenue. 
```
<p>
_What could be better:_
</p>

- I reccomend you try to stretch goals:
<p>


#### Stretch goals
- Write more about your idea. Tell us what the story's about. Show us why it's interesting. Continue to follow the inverted pyramid structure. 
- Improve your readability. Post your "before & after" scores from the Hemingway App.```
  </p>

#### Part 2 
<details><summary><em>Code review</em></summary>
<p>

_What went well:_

- I enjoyed the links you used! Great sources.:
  <p>
#### Can enter 'AAAA' search, then 'AAAB'.     A big complication is that I only know English making working with websites in other languages difficult or impossible.  
- [lists of websites by 4 character searches](http://biglistofwebsites.com/)

### Exports for json and xml (not free).  "Recent Lookups" another source of websites to scrape. 
- [finds technologies/libraries used by a web site](https://builtwith.com/)```


_What could be better:_

  </p>
- I strongly encourage you to attempt the stretch goals in the Sprints, because I believe you're cabable of doing them:
 <p>
#### Stretch goals
- Find more sources.
- Use Markdown to add images from your sources.
- Critically evaluate your sources in writing.

#### Part 3 
<details><summary><em>Code review</em></summary>
<p>

_What went well:_

- Great use of markdown and LaTeX! :
```python
$\textit{Markdown}\ \text{and LaTex:}\ a^2$
```

- Vast amount of links provided and you clearly described your project. Great job! 
  <p>
_What could be better:_
  </p>
- I reccomend posting this on Github pages for a more professional look!
